# Update CFF Authors from Pull Request Contributions

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This GitHub Action adds contributors to the `authors:` section of your `CITATION.cff` file by analyzing pull requests. It gathers information from commit authors, co-authors, PR reviewers, commenters, and linked issues to build a richer set of contributors. It also enriches contributor metadata using GitHub and ORCID.

üõë **Note:** This action does not modify your repository directly. It posts a comment on the pull request suggesting updates to your `CITATION.cff` file.

---

## üîß Features

- Updates `authors:` in `CITATION.cff` with contributors from PRs
- Parses commit authors, co-authors, PR reviewers, and commenters
- Detects users who opened or commented on linked issues
- Enriches metadata using GitHub profiles and ORCID lookups
- Skips duplicate authors using multiple identity checks
- Posts a pull request comment with the proposed CFF content

## üß† Contributor Classification and Identity Resolution

Contributors are grouped and processed according to their origin and identity metadata:

### 1. GitHub Users

When a contributor is associated with a GitHub account:

- **Individuals** (`type == "User"`):
  - Mapped to CFF `person`
  - Fields used: `given-names`, `family-names`, `alias`, `email`, `orcid`

- **Organizations** (`type == "Organization"`):
  - Mapped to CFF `entity`
  - Fields used: `name`, `alias`, `email` (if provided by GitHub)

> ORCID enrichment is only applied to individuals (`type: person`).

---

### 2. Non-GitHub Contributors

If a commit or co-author entry lacks a GitHub account (i.e. appears as a raw name/email):

- These are **initially treated as `entities`**.
- If the name + email match an existing CFF `person`, the contributor is promoted to `person`.
- ORCID search is attempted to enrich metadata.

#### Fields:
- `person`: `given-names`, `family-names`, `email`, `orcid`
- `entity`: `name`, `email`, `alias` (optional)

---

### Deduplication Strategy

Before adding a contributor, the following identifiers are checked against existing CFF `authors:`:

1. ORCID
2. Email address
3. GitHub alias (if available)
4. Full name (`given-names` + `family-names`)
5. Entity name

Only contributors with **no matching identity** are added.
